I Remember Pirelli’s advertisement well; 
there was one in particular that sparked my imagination.
The driver’s eyes are obscured by the tyre,
his hand holding the steering wheel.
Everything is in that drawing except for the car. 
The illustrator did not draw it, 
he wanted it to be imagined.
And in that, he succeeded completely with me; 
the car, my dream, would have been made in Modena. 
When I was a young boy, I remember Saturday 
being a special day.
I would spend the afternoon 
washing and polishing my motorbike 
and my father’s Torino.
But “Something” would have made it more beautiful.
Customizing the things you love 
doesn’t speak to us alone,
It tells others about us.
The Utopia’s silhouette 
is imprinted on Pirelli tyres, 
the hidden signature of a story that starts a new chapter: 
That of the person who will drive it.

I always find clothing
 just so funny.
When I was younger,
it was always about a costume 
or something to make me feel different 
and I think as I’ve gotten older,
You can use it as such a tool 
to express things 
maybe you can’t say with your voice.
There’s such a clever way
 about using clothing as a statement.
My personal style 
is I don’t really care,
slash, I do really care,
slash, whatever I feel that day.

Only in the cage can you touch the paws of a lion with your body
I’m Fine with Straight People, I Just Don’t Like When They Make it their whole Personality
It means that our name and body give credit to you
