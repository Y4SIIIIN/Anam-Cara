I Remember Pirelli’s advertisement well; 
there was one in particular that sparked my imagination.
The driver’s eyes are obscured by the tyre,
his hand holding the steering wheel.
Everything is in that drawing except for the car. 
The illustrator did not draw it, 
he wanted it to be imagined.
And in that, he succeeded completely with me; 
the car, my dream, would have been made in Modena. 
When I was a young boy, I remember Saturday 
being a special day.
I would spend the afternoon 
washing and polishing my motorbike 
and my father’s Torino.
But “Something” would have made it more beautiful.
Customizing the things you love 
doesn’t speak to us alone,
It tells others about us.
The Utopia’s silhouette 
is imprinted on Pirelli tyres, 
the hidden signature of a story that starts a new chapter: 
That of the person who will drive it.
